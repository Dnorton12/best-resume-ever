# How to Contribute

1. First you will need to fork the main repository.
2. You will then need to use git clone to create a copy
of the repo locally.
3. You will then need to create a new branch where you 
will make your changes.
4. Once you have completed your updates, you will need to
commit those changes using git commit.
5. You will then need to push the the branch those changes
were completed in to your repo on Github.
6. Finall you will need to open a pull request from the 
branch your changes were completed in, from the original
repository.
